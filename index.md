# Empathy 

![App Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0-green.svg)

Play Empathy to immerse in the pool of your own emotions!

 Introducing a brand new concept in gaming: a game that you don't play. In Empathy, you just sit back and enjoy what's given in life. You let go of everything and let Empathy take control of your emotions! You'll soon realize that the delicious cake in the background is what you have been asking for since the very beginning.

## What makes Empathy the best?

Well, did you try out the demo? I certainly hope so, otherwise you should definitely try it once. Playing Canon (Pachelbel) and some waves on the screen might not seem awesome, but [here's the bigger picture of what's going on in the backstage](docs/how-it-works.md):

Empathy's built with scalability in mind. It has been designed to work in multiple frameworks, (I think I'll also build a Python interface), will run on multiple OS, multiple CPUs, multiple GPUs, and what else? It's the scalability of Empathy that is more delicious than the current state of Empathy!

### I don't think Empathy's \*that\* great
I agree that the current song is not *that* interesting, but that's only as far as I can go with creativity. You yourself could write a better song than me! So why not try building your own song file? Check it out!

Again, I repeat: It's the scalability of Empathy that is more delicious than the current state of Empathy! It's the future that will be created as you and me and BumpSheep work together to make the world a better place!

## How can you contribute?

Empathy is just an engine; it also needs a driver. Who else can drive it better than you? You could compose a happy birthday surprise for your 8-year-old cousin living in Nevada or if you want to go even deeper, you could build a full mouse-controlled game that'd make anyone wonder on the existence of the cosmos. It'd be fantastic, for sure! All I need from you is support!

Would you consider helping me promote Empathy? I'd like to meet more developers like you and build a BIG Empathy community. All for the sake of making the world better.
