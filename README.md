#Empathy 

Got bored of playing good ol' games? Then play Empathy to immerse in the pool of your own emotions.


Some eternity ago, time was born, and some eternity afterwards, time will die. What I am is a tiny, insignificant creature living in this time clinging on to every activity in life in pursuit of happiness. But, happiness remains as only as long as I find something fascinating, which lasts merely for a moment of time. Time passes; I get bored; I seek new thing to occupy my mind, but again, the fascination fades away in time. The pattern rules me till my last breath. Life becomes dull. So dull that I don't want to live. 
  
 Oh, wait! I realize something! I realize that, as I was seeking happiness in various things, it was not the thing itself that mattered but how I felt it. I realize that my happiness is directly related to my emotions. So what if I played with my emotions directly? No it's insane, isn't it? Or maybe have I not just been reading the recent researches lately? Tonnes of them are in the internet: brain waves--all sorts of them--scientists are using them to study their effects on emotions. Maybe I could experience one myself? I think Empathy's the answer. 
 
 Empathy plays with my emotions.Not in a bad way, but in a good way. Semi-hypnosis, Semi-meditation, Semi-game: there are lots of techniques for the purpose of me living with my emotions? But I also know that Empathy is just the mediator, I am responsible to what I live like. I am in control of myself. I understand that I am my emotions. Hello Empathy! Let's just sit for a moment with you already!
