#Empathy 

Play Empathy to immerse in the pool of your own emotions.

==============================

Some time ago, I was born, and some time in the near future, I will die. What I am is a tiny, insignificant creature living in this short period in time clinging on to all sorts of activities in pursuit of happiness. But, happiness remains as only as long as I find the activity fascinating, which lasts merely for a moment of time. Time passes; I get bored; I seek new thing to occupy my mind, but even this fascination in a short period of time. This chain rules me till my last breath. My life has becomes dull. So dull that I don't want to live. 
  
 Oh, wait! I realize something! I realize that, as I was seeking happiness in various activities, it was not the activity itself that mattered but how I felt doing it. I realize that my happiness is directly related to my emotions. So what if rather than playing with boring activities, I played with my emotions directly? No it's insane, I can't do that. Or maybe have I not just been reading the recent researches lately? Tons of such researches are in the internet. Brain waves--all sorts of them--scientists are using them to study their effects on emotions. Maybe I could experience one myself? I think Empathy's the answer. 
 
 Empathy plays with my emotions. Not in a bad way, but in a good way. Semi-hypnosis, Semi-meditation, Semi-game: there are lots of techniques made for me to understand how I can play with my emotions. But I also know that Empathy is just the mediator, I am responsible to what I live like. I am in control of myself. I understand that I am my emotions. Hello Empathy! Let's just be together already!
